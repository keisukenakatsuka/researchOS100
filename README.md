▪️ Research OS 100 — Overview:

Research OS 100 is a self-directed 100-day project starting on January 1, 2026, designed to build a personal research operating system for an AI-native investor. Inspired by rapid daily building, the project focuses on creating a flexible and evolving research environment for work on startups, venture capital, and innovation policy.

This repository contains only public-facing artifacts. Exploratory work, raw data, and intermediate experiments are maintained separately in a private repository.

▪️ Purpose:

Generative AI has dramatically lowered the cost of producing research outputs. As a result, the primary bottleneck in research has shifted from execution to iteration.

The purpose of Research OS 100 is to develop the habit of continuous experimentation by prioritizing speed over polish and improvement over completion. Rather than optimizing for finished products, the project emphasizes documenting the thinking process itself, so that methods can be revisited, refined, or replaced as tools and models evolve.

▪️ Project Scope:

The project covers practical research utilities, including the following areas.
・Literature discovery and review
・Data collection and lightweight processing
・Visualization and exploratory analysis
・Simple modeling and evaluation workflows

Large language models may be used for tasks such as summarization, extraction, scoring, or workflow support. Each day contributes one small but functional component toward a reusable and extensible research system.

▪️ Non-goals:

Research OS 100 does not aim to produce polished academic papers, investment recommendations, or production-grade systems.

Outputs are intentionally lightweight, experimental, and subject to frequent revision. The focus is on learning velocity and system design rather than completeness or optimality.

▪️ Repository Structure:

notebooks/
・Public Jupyter notebooks demonstrating daily tools, experiments, and prototypes.

src/
・Reusable scripts, helpers, and shared utilities.

docs/
・Figures, references, and supporting materials.

Private drafts, intermediate experiments, and raw datasets are managed separately in a private repository.

▪️ Progress Summary (as of Day 001):

Day 001 focused on designing and implementing the initial arXiv ingestion workflow, enabling daily monitoring of research related to startups, venture capital, and innovation policy.

▪️ Technical Environment:

The project is implemented primarily in Python using Jupyter Lab and standard scientific computing libraries. External APIs and large language models are integrated as needed, with an intentionally flexible technical stack to accommodate rapid changes in tools, models, and best practices.

▪️ Note on AI Usage:

Large language models are used as research aids, such as summarization, extraction, ideation, and workflow support, not as authoritative sources.

All interpretations, judgments, and conclusions remain human-driven, and any errors or omissions are the author’s responsibility.

▪️ Long-term Goal:

The long-term goal of Research OS 100 is to establish a reproducible, scalable, and continuously evolving research foundation at the intersection of startups, venture capital, and innovation policy.

Beyond the 100-day challenge, the system is intended to remain under active development, gradually enabling partial automation of the research pipeline while preserving transparency and human judgment.
