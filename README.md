1. RESEARCH OS 100 OVERVIEW
Research OS 100 is a 100-day project to build a personal research operating system in preparation for entering a PhD program in August 2026. It focuses on startup ecosystems, venture capital, innovation policy, and the role of government intervention. This repository contains only public-facing outputs; exploratory work and raw data are stored separately in a private repository.

2. PURPOSE
Generative AI is advancing rapidly, and methods that once required substantial manual effort can now be produced or assisted by AI within minutes. To keep pace, it is essential to build habits of continuous experimentation and updating of research methods. The project encourages daily iteration and aims to establish a flexible workflow that evolves with new techniques. The long-term goal is to develop a semi-autonomous research agent capable of handling major parts of the research pipeline with transparent logic.

3. PROJECT SCOPE
The project includes tools for literature analysis, data collection, data processing, visualization, simple modeling, and other research utilities. Some tools may incorporate language models for tasks such as summarization, extraction, or workflow support. Each day contributes one tool or module toward building a reusable research environment.

4. REPOSITORY STRUCTURE
Public notebooks are stored in the notebooks directory, reusable scripts in the src directory, and figures or references in the docs directory. Private work, drafts, and raw datasets are maintained in researchOS100-private.

5. PROGRESS SUMMARY
Day 1 focused on creating a custom viewer to retrieve and organize arXiv papers related to startups, venture capital, and innovation policy. The tool includes a query interface, sorting by publication date, a clean display, and CSV export. This formed the initial template for the project.

7. TECHNICAL ENVIRONMENT
The project uses Python, Jupyter Lab, and standard scientific libraries. Additional APIs and language models may be added as the project develops.

8. LONG-TERM GOAL
Research OS 100 aims to create a reproducible and scalable research foundation for long-term work in startup ecosystems, venture capital, and innovation policy. The objective is to enter the PhD program with a fully operational research environment and the habit of continuously updating methods.
